# CVE ID
CVE-2024-30694

# Title
Shell Injection Vulnerability in ROS2 Galactic Geochelone

# Vulnerability Type
Bash Shell Injection

# Severity
TBD

# Vendor
The Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF)

# Products Affected
ROS2 Galactic Geochelone (ROS_VERSION=2 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3)

# Description
A shell injection vulnerability was discovered in ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) Galactic Geochelone. The vulnerability exists due to the way ROS2 handles shell command execution in components like command interpreters or interfaces that process external inputs. This flaw allows for remote code execution (RCE) and can be exploited through various attack vectors, potentially leading to remote code execution, escalating privileges, and causing a range of detrimental effects.

# Impact
Escalation of Privileges: True; 
Information Disclosure: True; 
Other: This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized system access and control, operational disruption, the spread of malware, and damage to trust and reputation.

# Attack Vector
The vulnerability can be exploited through malicious file downloads, exploiting input validation flaws, phishing or social engineering, and compromised network traffic.

# Solution
Users are advised to update to the latest version of ROS2 Galactic Geochelone where the vulnerability has been addressed. Ensure that all components and dependencies are also updated to secure versions.

# Workaround
If immediate updating is not possible, it is recommended to implement strict input validation, enhance monitoring of network traffic, and educate users about the risks of phishing and malicious downloads.

# CVE Status
Confirmed and published.
